    title: About Me
    summary: |
      Hi! I'm in my second year of Biomedical Engineering at UBC. 
      
      Apart from engineering, my interests include <strong>politics</strong>, <strong>theology</strong>, and <strong>baking</strong> (I regularly make sourdough and cheesecake for my friends).

    title: Technical Experience
    info:
      - role: UBC Engineering Design Team
        time: 2022 - Present
        company: Multiple Sclerosis to Movement
        details: |
          Multiple Sclerosis to Movement (M2M) is a project within the Biomedical Engineering Student Team (BEST) at UBC.
           
          Our team is working on designing a glove that sends data to 
          an app with mobile games we're designing to enhance the MS rehabilitation process of the hand; 
          the journey through physical therapy can be emotionally challenging, and we aim to make the process a little more fun.
          We will be entering the <a href="https://simoncoxcompetition.com/"><u>Simon Cox</u></a> competition this year.
          
          I am on the mechanical engineering sub-team, and am currently designing a box that uses a magnet system to automate
          the removal and donning of the glove. 
          
          Techinical skills I've learned in during my role in BEST include:
          - Woodworking
          - Soldering
          - Arduino
          - Python
          - Solidworks
          
          Softskills I've developped during my role include: teamwork, communication, problem-solving, adaptability, leadership, creativity, and critical thinking.


      - role: Research Volunteer
        time: 2022
        company: iGEM University of Calgary
        details: |
          The summer going into university I volunteered for a U of C student research team. 
          My biggest contribution was my study of different ways to make the bacteria cellulose transparent — industry experts 
          that the team consulted said it was an essential part of the project (we were designing compostable fruit packaging). 
          
          The team won the <a href="https://jamboree.igem.org/2022"><u>iGEM 2022 award</u><a> for Best Sustainable Development Impact. 

          Wet and dry lab skills I developped include: 
          - Preparing media
          - Autoclaving
          - Calibrating pipettes
          - MATLAB
          - 3D printing (CAD)

            Summer of last year (2023) I decided that I wanted to start a club for
            conservative students on campus...and then I found out we already had one (haha).

            It can feel lonely being a conservative student in Vancouver, but I've found such an
            amazing community in the UBC Conservatives club. We mainly have two events: guest speakers and pub nights. 
            
            We also will participate in club days, hosting booths, which I have a ton of fun volunteering at. 
            It's so important to engage with students (that are largely subjected to one kind of ideology)
            and have important conversations about important stuff (western civilisation is depending on it).
