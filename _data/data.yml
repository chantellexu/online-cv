    summary: |
      Hi! I'm in my second year of Biomedical Engineering at UBC. 
      
      Apart from engineering, my interests include <strong>politics</strong>, <strong>theology</strong>, and <strong>baking</strong> (I regularly make sourdough bread and cheesecake for my friends).

    title: Technical Experience
    info:
      - role: UBC Engineering Design Team
        time: 2022 - Present
        company: Multiple Sclerosis to Movement
        details: |
          Multiple Sclerosis to Movement (M2M) is a project within the Biomedical Engineering Student Team (BEST).
           
          Our team is designing a glove that sends data to 
          an app with games that enhance the MS rehabilitation process of the hand; 
          the journey through physical therapy can be emotionally challenging, and we aim to make the process a little more fun.
          We will be entering the <a href="https://simoncoxcompetition.com/"><u>Simon Cox</u></a> competition this year.
          
          I am on the mechanical engineering sub-team, and am currently designing a box that uses a magnet system to automate
          the removal and donning of the glove. 
          
          Technical skills I've learned in during my role in BEST include:
          - Woodworking
          - Soldering
          - Arduino
          - Python
          - Solidworks
          
          Soft skills I've developed during my role include: teamwork, communication, problem-solving, adaptability, leadership, creativity, and critical thinking.


      - role: Research Volunteer
        time: 2022
        company: iGEM University of Calgary
        details: |
          The summer going into university I volunteered for a U of C student research team. 
          My biggest contribution was my study of the different ways to make bacteria cellulose transparent; industry experts 
          said it was an essential part of the project (we were using bacteria cellulose to create compostable fruit packaging). 
          
          The team won the <a href="https://jamboree.igem.org/2022"><u>iGEM 2022 award</u><a> for Best Sustainable Development Impact. 

          Lab skills I developed include: 
          - Preparing media
          - Autoclaving
          - Calibrating pipettes
          - MATLAB 
          - Python
          - 3D printing (CAD)

            Summer of last year (2023) I decided that I wanted to start a club for
            conservative students on campus...and then I found out we already had one.

            It can feel lonely being a conservative student in Vancouver, but the UBC Conservatives club
            has introduced me to such an amazing community. We mainly have two events: guest speakers and pub nights. 
            
            We also participate in club days, hosting booths, which I have a ton of fun volunteering at. 
            It's so important to engage with students (that are largely subjected to one kind of ideology)
            and to have the conversations that most students aren't having (western civilisation is depending on it).
            It's also so crucial for conservative students at UBC to know that they're not alone.
